## Principals - _Circuits empowers by being_:

- :balance_scale: **Elegant**: strike a balance between usability and capability
  - build for the novice but empower the expert
  - Automate difficult concepts rather than dumbing them down
- :hammer_and_wrench: **Productive**: a little effort does a lot of work
  - Building should be an adventure, it shouldn't be a chore
  - If something must be done frequently, it can also be done quickly
- :arrows_counterclockwise: **Reusable**: player creations are indistinguishable from our own
  - Inventions achieve the quality of content built in Unity
  - Allow the community to rely on each other, rather than only relying on us
- :handshake: **Friendly**: physicality isn't a burden
  - Prioritize quick, intuitive solutions over popups and forms
  - Expose as much information as necessary but no more than that
- :mag: **Obvious**: errors aren't hidden
  - If you have an error, you know where and why
  - Finding a solution shouldn't require a PhD
