# V2.28

## General Changes
- Added speed and acceleration configure settings to Piston V2 and Rotator V2
- Configuring an Object Board will now display a button that will open the configuration menu for the attached object.
  - This button has been placed in a new "Rec Room Object" foldout, and the existing "Detach from object" toggle has been moved into it.
  - The existing "Detach from object" button will no longer appear on player boards where it would previously display an error.
  - "Detach From Object" has been renamed to "Detach From Rec Room Object"
  - Similarly, there is a new button on the configuration menu for `Creation Object`s with Object Boards, that will open the configuration menu for the attached Object Board.
- Color improvements
  - Adjusted light object boards to use the `Color` type, rather than color index int
      - Modified boards for the Point Light, Spotlight, and Dome Light
      - Added default port values to match the existing Dome Light values
  - Removed Color type related chips from beta, including:
      - Color Constant
      - Color (variable)
      - Color to Int
      - Emitter Set Color V2
      - Light Set Color V2
      - List Color (variable)
      - Text Set Color V2
  - Added palette filter paths to the new dome light chips
      - 'Light Set Specular Node V2' and 'Light Set Softness Node V2' have been added to Object/Light

## Deprecations

## Bugs Fixed
- Fixed formatting on the port renaming field to match other chip configuration fields.
  The field now correctly allows for spaces.
- Fixed a bug that caused reflection probes to not revert to their original state after deselecting a Sky Dome chip
- Fixed input configuration and variable home values input fields for Bool, String, and Int values:
  - Bool values will now use a toggle, rather than typing "true" or "false" into a text field
  - String values will now use a multiline input area, rather than a single-line text field
  - Int values will use an int input field, which performs input validation and enables the numerical keyboard on VR
- Fixed seat thumbnail in the palette so it's no longer invisible
- Sample Audio offset input is fixed in VR
- Fixed Cloud Variable settings page not populating correctly after closing and reopening it
