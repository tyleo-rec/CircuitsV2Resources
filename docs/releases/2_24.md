# V2.24

## General Changes

- Lights now use `float`s rather than `int`s
  - If you have a room currently using the `int` chips it will still work
  - The chips have been removed from the palette but still function in rooms which already have them
- Cooldown on `Toggle Button V2` has been reduced
  - Shooting these with weapons will now be more responsive
- A "Can Modify with Circuits" checkbox has been added to shapes
  - You now need to check this checkbox to use `Set Position` or `Respawn` on the shape
  - It has no additional ink cost

- `Dice V2` now works properly for all faces
- Rotating objects in trigger volume does not trigger events
- Players can now teleport while an impulse is being applied with a chip
- You can now send `Vector3`s and `Quaternion`s with events
- When you break objects inside of a `Trigger Volume V2` they trigger an exit
- The picture-in-picture local player display no longer renders CV2 wires
- `Rotator Get Rotation Speed` result does not depend on orientation of Rotator V2
- Attaching and detaching from a gizmo no longer prevents objects from moving
