# V2.4

## Breaking Changes

These changes may require you to update your rooms.

* Trig nodes now make use of degrees rather than radians:
  * `Acos`
  * `Asin`
  * `Atan`
  * `Atan2`
  * `Sin`
  * `Cos`
  * `Tan`
* Trigger volumes can now detect other trigger volumes

## General Changes

* `Log` has been renamed to `Logarithm`
* More chips connect correctly. For example:
  * The output of `Add` can be connected directly to chips like `IntToFloat`
  * The output of `FromCreationObject` can be connected directly to chips like `ToCombatant`
* Disconnected `Delay`s no longer loop infinitely
* Performance has been improved
  * Players should experience lower heat usage
  * As we continue to tweak heat usage players may see it go up or down in future updates

## New Chips

* `Log`: Logs a string to a Log Screen
* `HasAuthorityOf`: Checks whether the local player has authority of a `CreationObject`

## New Objects

We added these objects with this update. Look for nodes prefixed with their names in the palette!

* `Emitter V2`
* `Log Screen`
* `Point Light V2`
* `Spot Light V2`
* `Text V2`
