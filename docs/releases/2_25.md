# V2.25

## General Changes

- A new `Color` type has been added to the game.
  - Many chips which worked with `int` color indices now work with `Color` too.
  - `int` indices will slowly be removed over the next few months (without breaking any rooms).
- To help with debugging, CV2 wires will now flash when they are used.
  - Enable and disable the different types of wire flash in Settings.
  - Execution Flash is enabled by default, while Data Flash is disabled, to keep the visual noise down.
  - Hover over an output port to see the path of wires from which its value is derived.
