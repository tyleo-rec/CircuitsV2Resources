# V2.1

## Breaking Changes

These changes may require you to update your rooms.

* AILookAtNode
  * Now only connects to AI, Combatant, CreationObject, PatrolPoint, Player and Vector3 types.
  * It used to connect to anything but it doesn't work with any types besides these.
* InvalidPlayerVariableNode no longer uses the variable mesh.
  * The invalid player isn't a variable.
* LocalPlayerVariableNode no longer uses the variable mesh.
  * The local player isn't a variable.
* EqualsNode now works correctly in all cases.
* IsValidNode now returns correct result in all cases. Nodes now need special logic to work with invalid objects.
  * Many nodes which previously tried to work with invalid objects now return errors. Some of these used to null ref.
* Unset player variables now correspond to invalid players.
* All variables now have names to help distinguish them
  * Unnamed variables will be updated to named ones.
  * Names are automatically generated when variables are placed or can be set manually.
  * Variables with the same name will always refer to the same value (they change together)
  * Variables with different names will always refer to different values (one may change without impacting the others)
