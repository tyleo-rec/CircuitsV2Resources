# V2.8

## General Changes

* Circuits V2 has been added to palette search. We've also made an overhaul of the search feature to add filters. Be sure to check it out.
* We are migrating to a new style for variable chips:
    * These include get _and_ set functionality in one chip.
    * There will be one chip for each type in the palette that can be configured local or synced.
    * Old style variable chips, along with `Set Value` will eventually go away.
    * New style variables do not yet have changed events but they are coming soon.
* `Player Definition Board` can now be used to create logic on players.
    * One `Player Definition Board` in each room can be set to Active from the Configuration menu.
    * All nodes within that board will be copied into a `Player Reference Board` on each player who joins the room.
* Type names now appear above ports when hovering them with the wire tool.
* Many math nodes now work with `Vector3`s:
    * `Add Node`
    * `Divide Node`
    * `Multiply Node`
    * `Subtract Node`
* We now support adding and removing from lists with up to 50 elements.
* Base classes are now supported in CV2. This means that many existing types can be connected directly to `Creation Object` ports, including:
    * AI
    * Button
    * CreationObject
    * Die
    * DynamicLight
    * Emitter
    * LogScreen
    * PatrolPoint
    * Piston
    * Rotator
    * Sound Effect Gizmo
    * Text Tool
    * Toggle Button
    * Trigger Volume
    * Vector Gadget
* We've made a public [json file](https://github.com/tyleo-rec/CircuitsV2Resources/blob/master/misc/chip_data.json) describing our chips.
    * Feel free to use this file on projects of your own.
    * If you update the data in this file we may pull it back into the game!

* Hovering over ports will no longer clear their default values.
